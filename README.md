# CryptoAccountInfo
Retrieves balance and open-order info from Bittrex and estimates portfolio value.

This is a command line Python 3 program that uses the Bittrex API to fetch personal account information and current coin prices. Portfolio value is estimated using a public Bitcoin index API. 

To use, sign into Bittrex and create a read-only API key & secret. Then fill those values into "api_key" and "api_secret".
